                <p>I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the foundational technologies for building user interfaces on the web. Familiarity with popular frontend frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, or jQuery can be essential, depending on the specific projects you work on. Proficiency in using version control systems like Git is important for collaborating with other developers and managing code changes effectively. Effective communication with team members, including designers, backend developers, and project managers, is essential for successful project execution. Having a strong portfolio of past projects can showcase your skills and expertise to potential employers or clients. Adhering to coding standards and best practices helps maintain clean and maintainable code, which is easier for teams to work with and extend.</p>
